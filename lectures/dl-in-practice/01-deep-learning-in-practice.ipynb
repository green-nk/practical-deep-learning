        "#### How Our Image Recognizer works\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look through the code first.\n",
        "\n",
        "`untar_data` function has downloaded a standardard dataset from the [fast.ai datasets collection](https://course.fast.ai/datasets) (if not previously downloaded) to your server, extracts it (if not previously extracted), and returns a `Path` object with the extracted location:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we define a function, `is_cat`, which labels cats based on a filename rule provided by the dataset creators:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "is_cat = lambda x: x[0].isupper()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we need to tell `fastai` what kind of dataset we have and how it is structured:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\n",
        "    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,\n",
        "    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various different classes for different kinds of deep learning datasets and problems—here we're using `ImageDataLoaders`. The first part of the class name will generally be the type of data you have, such as image, or text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other important piece of information that we have to tell `fastai` is how to get the labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of the filename, or path—most commonly the parent folder name. fastai comes with a number of standardized labeling methods, and ways to write your own. Here we're telling fastai to use the `is_cat` function we just defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we define the `Transform`s that we need. A `Transform` contains code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined `Transform`s, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds: `item_tfms` are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square), while `batch_tfms` are applied to a *batch* of items at a time using the GPU, so they're particularly fast!\n",

        "Why 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything.

The filenames start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise. We have to tell `fastai` how to get labels from the filenames, which we do by calling `from_name_func` (which means that labels can be extracted using a function applied to the filename), and passing `is_cat`, which returns `x[0].isupper()`, which evaluates to `True` if the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it's a cat).\n",

This 20% of the data is called the *validation set*; the remaining 80% is called the *training set*. The validation set is used to measure the accuracy of the model. By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly. The parameter `seed=42` sets the *random seed* to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set."

Most of the time, however, picking an architecture isn't a very important part of the deep learning process. It's something that academics love to talk about, but in practice it is unlikely to be something you need to spend much time on. There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called _ResNet_ that we'll be talking a lot about during the book; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are `18`, `50`, `101`, and `152`). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse). On the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\n",

Another common metric for classification is `accuracy` (which is just `1.0 - error_rate`). There are many more to cover in the later lecture.\n",

The entire purpose of loss is to define a \"measure of performance\" that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case.\n",

A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a *pretrained model*. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. And, as you'll see, in a deep learning model many of these capabilities are things you'll need, almost regardless of the details of your project. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using a pretrained model, `vision_learner` will remove the last layer, since that is always specifically customized to the original training task (i.e. ImageNet dataset classification), and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with.

        "\n",
        "The solution to this conundrum is to introduce another level of even more highly reserved data, the *test set*. Just as we hold back the validation data from the training process, we must hold back the test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model; it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts. In effect, we define a hierarchy of cuts of our data, based on how fully we want to hide it from training and modeling processes: training data is fully exposed, the validation data is less exposed, and test data is totally hidden. This hierarchy parallels the different kinds of modeling and evaluation processes themselves—the automatic training process with back propagation, the more manual process of trying different hyper-parameters between training sessions, and the assessment of our final result.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy. If you're creating a cat detector, for instance, you generally want at least 30 cats in your validation set. That means that if you have a dataset with thousands of items, using the default 20% validation set size may be more than you need. On the other hand, if you have lots of data, using some of it for validation probably doesn't have any downsides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having two levels of \"reserved data\"—a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself—may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we *always* need a separate test set—if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set—but generally it's best to use one if at all possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "This same discipline can be critical if you intend to hire a third party to perform modeling work on your behalf. A third party might not understand your requirements accurately, or their incentives might even encourage them to misunderstand them. A good test set can greatly mitigate these risks and let you evaluate whether their work solves your actual problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it bluntly, if you're a senior decision maker in your organization (or you're advising senior decision makers), the most important takeaway is this: if you ensure that you really understand what test and validation sets are and why they're important, then you'll avoid the single biggest source of failures we've seen when organizations decide to use AI. For instance, if you're considering bringing in an external vendor or service, make sure that you hold out some test data that the vendor *never gets to see*. Then *you* check their model on your test data, using a metric that *you* choose based on what actually matters to you in practice, and *you* decide what level of performance is adequate. (It's also a good idea for you to try out some simple baseline yourself, so you know what a really simple model can achieve. Often it'll turn out that your simple model performs just as well as one produced by an external \"expert\"!)"

Lots of pictures are of the same drivers in different positions. If you were an insurance company building a model from this data, note that you would be most interested in how the model performs on drivers it hasn't seen before (since you would likely have training data only for a small group of people). In recognition of this, the test data for the competition consists of images of people that don't appear in the training set.\n",

Another perspective is that if you used all the people in training your model, your model might be overfitting to particularities of those specific people, and not just learning the states (texting, eating, etc.)."

As you will see, it is very easy to create a model that does a great job at making predictions on the exact data it has been trained on, but it is much harder to make accurate predictions on data the model has never seen before. And of course, this is the data that will actually matter in practice. For instance, if you create a handwritten digit classifier and use it to recognize numbers written on checks, then you are never going to see any of the numbers that the model was trained on—checks will have slightly different variations of writing to deal with. You will learn many methods to avoid overfitting in this course. \n",
